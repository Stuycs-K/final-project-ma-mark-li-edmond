## Overview

Our game will be based on the card game Uno. In the game, you and 3 other bots are going to play the game until one person empties their deck. At the start, each player gets 8 random cards . Initially, the turn order is counterclockwise. On your turn, you can place your card down only if it is the same color or number as the previous card placed down, or keep drawing until you get a card you can place down. There are also special cards such as reverse the turn order, skip the turn of the next player, add more cards to the next player, and force the color of the card. 

## Instructions

To play the game, just run Game.pde, no libraries necessary.

On your turn, you can click the card you want to place. If it's an invalid placement, a text will appear on the screen. If it's a wild card where you can choose the color, click one of the four colored block in the center and the game will move on. If the last card is a +2 card, you can play a non +2 card and draw two cards or play a +2 card to stack.
